## Description
an application that could be deployed by a vet as a way of communicating with their customers. Customers are able to create accounts and log in to view information on their pets, add new furry friends to the family, and more.

The goal was to make the pets health, care, and services required easy to access and help remind fur parents what might be coming up for their pet in terms of health care.

## Future Goals
Vet Dashboard to view all customers and their pets. Vets being able to search of customers, specific pets, or other information stored in the database. Being able to update pet info. Pets getting a list of servies the vet recomends, when those services are due, and provide history on the pet as well.
